### About me

I am front-end developer with 2+ years of experience. I've been working with Angular 2+ framework for over two years and I had opportunity to create several projects.
I was working with technologies like: Angular 2+, Angular Material, RXJS, NGRX, Bootstrap, Python, Django, Rest API.
Currently I am lead front-end developer in Movemeback, where I had opportunity to pick technologies and set architecture for few of our Angular projects.
